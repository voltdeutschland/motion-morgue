# motion-morgue

A temporary holding place for recovering the party assembly records before they can be properly archived.

## The Problem

Years of assembly documentation - protocols, motions, amendments, election results - exist scattered across various formats, incomplete folders, and personal archives.
Some records are missing entirely.
There is no single source of truth.

## The Purpose

This tool collects and organizes what remains:

- **Assemblies** with their protocols
- **Motions** and their original documents
- **Amendments** to those motions

Each record can be added even when incomplete.
Missing PDFs are marked as placeholders to be filled in later.

## The Goal

Once recovered and validated, this data will be migrated into a proper decision database.
